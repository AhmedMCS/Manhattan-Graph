# NYC Manhattan Graph Project

## Project Overview
The **NYC Manhattan Graph Project** visualizes and analyzes the structure of Manhattan using a weighted graph. The graph nodes represent key locations within Manhattan, and the edges are the routes with associated weights noting distance.

This project demonstrates the use of graph-based algorithms to find optimal paths, and model transportation.

## Motivation
New York City, particularly Manhattan, is a dense urban environment. Modeling its layout using graph theory allows for efficient route planning, optimization, and analysis. This project aims to provide insight into real-world applications of graph theory in urban planning and transportation.



## Features
- **Graph Representation**: Nodes represent intersections, and edges represent roads with weights assigned based on distance or estimated travel time.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementation of Dijkstraâ€™s for finding the shortest path between two locations
- **Visualization**: Visualize the graph of Manhattan streets and the paths between locations.
- **Weighted Graph**: Support for adding and manipulating weights on edges to simulate traffic, distance, or other factors.
